    <h1>
      A hamburger or simply burger is a food consisting of fillings—usually a
      patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread
      roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
      pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard,
      mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand
      Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A
      hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

        , romanized: McDonald's Yisra'el) is the Israeli
        master franchise of the fast food restaurant chain McDonald's. Operated
        and licensed by Alonyal Limited (Hebrew: אלוניאל בע"מ, Alonyal Ba'am),
        McDonald's Israel is the largest[1] of Israel's burger chains with a 60%
        market share.[1] It was the first Israeli outlet to be opened in 1993
        and a major competitor of the local restaurant chain Burger Ranch.[2]
        The world's first kosher McDonald's was opened in Mevaseret Zion in
        October 1995.[1] McDonald's Israel is owned and run by Israeli
        businessman Omri Padan. Padan is President of Alonyal Limited which is
        local licensee for McDonald's.[3] Currently McDonald's has 228
        restaurants in Israel, with 69 of them under Kosher supervision,[4]
        meaning they are closed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, have no mixed
        meat and dairy products (such as cheeseburgers), and for Passover they
        serve the meat on Passover buns. In Israel, most branches are non-kosher
        since they serve cheeseburgers (which are non-kosher, i.e. do not
        conform to traditional Jewish dietary law) by special request (they are
        not on the menu) and they serve milk-based desserts (ice cream,
        milkshakes). Some of the kosher branches serve milk products in a
        separate section of the restaurant. McDonald's Israel does not operate
        restaurants in the West Bank and Golan Heights.[5] McDonald's Israel
        claims to source over 80% of its ingredients locally. This includes
        kosher beef patties, potatoes, lettuce, buns and milkshake mix.[3]
        McTouch - McDonald's Israel McTouch - McDonald's Israel History 1990s A
        McDonald's in Ashkelon, Israel (2007) McDonald's entered Israel in 1993.
        The first branch was at the Ayalon Mall in Ramat Gan.[6] In the wake of
        a controversy over importing French fries to Israel, the American fast
        food chain decided to manufacture frozen French fries in Israel at a
        cost of $5 million US.[7] In 1994, the Golani Interchange branch aroused
        controversy when the restaurant installed a large 'golden arches' sign
        in front of the Golani Brigade museum and memorial. Bereaved families
        and other citizens claimed this desecrated the site. The sign was later
        reduced in size
